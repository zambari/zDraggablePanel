# zDraggablePanel
A little bit bootstrap UI, provides a way to have multiple windows of whatever floating on canvas, each window can be moved and resized. nothing too fancy but something I tend to use a lot - early on with the project there's plenty of debug stuff on screen and I got tired of writing IPointerEnterHandler's for each and every window. Hence comes this littlee template.

SOME bells and whisless added, like the expandable menu and works started on windows grouping

Provided project has an example 'placeholder' panel, with edges you can resize the panel by, minimze button, and a header that can be used to move the panel around. Panels can also be folded and unfolder (also folded and unfolded in gangs) but that functionality could use a bit of love (no way to connectd/disconnect windows at runtime, this needs to be done in the editor)
