# zDraggablePanel (Unity3D)
A little bit bootstrap UI, provides a way to have multiple windows of whatever floating on canvas, each window can be moved and resized. nothing too fancy but something I tend to use a lot - early on with the project there's plenty of debug stuff on screen and I got tired of writing IPointerEnterHandler's for each and every window. Hence comes this little template.

Last release focuses on ease of use - Whilst there is one prefab still neded (or two if you want to turn your panels off and on), but the script will now build the borders aroud a given panel on its own, in editor window, so using it requires just adding a component 
 
Here's a short video demonstration. New release adds some features like Image borders, which can be drawn narrow but raycast from a wider area, Corners (two dimensional scaling),  and a new menu.
